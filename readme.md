Cryptograhpy with Java
======================
Secure Client - Server communication
----------------------

This project uses **Bouncycastle Provider**.
Before Running replace *Security Policy Files* with *Java Cryptography Extension* in JRE Path so you are able to use large encryption keys

This Project includes:
----------------------
- Simple Client-Server app *(Server.java , Client.java)*
- Classes to perform AES , RSA encryprion and calculate digest *(AES.java,RSA.java,Digest.java)*
- Client - Server app with symmetric encryption *(ServerAES.java,ClientAES.java)*

###Screenshots of project running, wireshark captures to test the connection and  more info in [readme.pdf](https://github.com/alexzzzboom/Cryptography/blob/master/ReadMe.pdf)
